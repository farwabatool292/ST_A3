1. What is SAST?
Static application security testing (SAST) tools automatically scan the source code of an application.
The goal is to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. SAST tools perform white-box testing, which
involves analyzing the code based on inside knowledge of the application.

2. Benefits:
SAST offers granularity in detecting vulnerabilities, providing an assessment down to the line of code.
The are key benefits of SAST tools are: 
-> Examine the codebase of an application in one test.
-> Test an application before compiling or running the code.
-> Identify vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), which is when vulnerabilities
are easiest and cheapest to fix.
