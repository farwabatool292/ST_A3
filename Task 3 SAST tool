1. What is SAST?
Static application security testing (SAST) tools automatically scan the source code of an application.
The goal is to identify vulnerabilities before deployment. SAST tools perform white-box testing, which
involves analyzing the code based on inside knowledge of the application.

2. Benefits:
SAST offers granularity in detecting vulnerabilities, providing an assessment down to the line of code.
The are key benefits of SAST tools are: 
-> Examine the codebase of an application in one test.
-> Test an application before compiling or running the code.
-> Identify vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle (SDLC), which is when vulnerabilities
are easiest and cheapest to fix.

3. SAST tool for our Project:
We choose nessus tool for our JAVA project.

4. What is Nessus tool?
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures architecture is used by Nessus, an open-source network vulnerability scanner,
to make it simple for compliant security solutions to cross-link with one another. The Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL),
a straightforward language used by Nessus, is used to specify specific threats and potential attacks.

5- Statical Analysis
Target URL :
SETUP 
1-first create a new scan on nessus 
2-select the web application test 
3-perform  setting of basic.
4-port setting to commom ports

CREDENTIAL
 Set authentication method.
PLUGINS
 for web application test the  Webservers plugin family is used
 
 after that save it and  launch it for scan .
 
SCAN RESULT:
to view result OWASP is used.
In vulnerqability, all the  vulenrabilities existing in web app and its level are identifed.
