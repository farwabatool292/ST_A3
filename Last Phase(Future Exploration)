                                                     ** Topic: AI based Test Automation for application testing **

------------------------------------------------------( Introduction )---------------------------------------------------------
Application/software testing have evolved a lot in decades.In Earlier ,there was only manual testing where each and every step was written and 
executed manually.This was qite a time consuming task.For this automation has came in the form of different paid and open source tools.
they help us to automate the test cases and exectue them and generate reports.Now a third wave has struck in the worls of software testing 
with the advance artifical Intelligence.The overall evaution of application testing is:

Manual testing -> Automation Tools(Eclipse,Katalon studio etc) -> Frameworks(Test-NG,JUnit etc) -> CI/CD(Agile) -> AI(Third wave)

Testing and test automation in particular have "Everything's better with AI" bug.It is obvious that AI will find it's way into test automation 
in which AI Machine learning, and neural network are the trendy things right now.


------------------------------------------------------( What is AI and ML )----------------------------------------------------
machine Learning us the subset of Artificial Intelligence learning.It is like giving machine ability to learn by itself.
For example if we search something on googlr and spend sometine in that specific thing.With the help of ML google will understand the users specific
needs and accordingly show those links and ads to that users.


-------------------------------------------( why just Test automation is not enough )-------------------------------------------
As we have a large number of test auomation tools,test frame works but these are not enough.We are lagging some where in the testing department that's 
why AI with test automation become our need.The points where we have drawback for only Test Automations are as under:

1- Redundant test cases: which test pack/case are ideal and have big impact for testing the application
2- Flakiness of testing: filing or passing even we dont make changes.
3- Test independencies
4- High volum of test data
Hence all the above points tells that we make some thing extra for the test automation.

-----------------------------------------------------( Integration of AI IN  TEST AUTOMATION FOR APP TESTING  )----------------------------------------------------------
Below are some of the application of AI in Test Automation which include unit testing ,user interface ,API tesing and also tips for maintaining the test suites.

1: Ai based test Automation for Unit Testing:

As unit testing plays a imporatant role in continuous integration/continue delivery(CI/CD).If we see according to the developer prospetive,he spend almost half of
it project time in maintaing and writing clear application code and the test each unit test case.After unit testing,remaining work will be just integration with other 
parts.So for automation unit testing creation can be useful.

Pros:
some of the benefits for creation and updation of unit testing is as under:
• It is the significant step of templatebased unit test by using static and dynamic anaylsis.So we can actual test the code notby making dtub.
• It is very quickly and used for a existing complete body of source code for software and proram. 
• Developer need no extra effoer just need to modify and set up the unit testing tool.
Cons:
• Unit tesing generated by the machine learning may break the existing unit test cases so it is hardly depend on developer how to ensure that noting happened.
• Developer have to write the comple logic by himself.
•Unit test is simple the mirror of code on which they buit they even not guess the intended functionality of the code.

2:Automated User Interface Testing:

   1-The AI has helped in Automating the User interface testing.In the Al-based UI TEsting, the tools that are used for test automation,they parse the DOM and all the related code 
to discover the object properties.In addition to that, the image recognition techniques are also used in order to naviagte trhought the whole application and then 
perform the visual verification of the UI objects and elements to create UI tests.

   2-For bugs identification in the APP UI , the AI related test systems use the appraoch of exploratory testing and create the screenshots of results.
   3- The layout,color,font and size  of the under test system can also be verified through such systems.

Pros:
    1- flexibilty in the test cases to ignore the minor changes in the UI,resulting in not failure of test cases.becasue the AI models are trained and 
     they can handle such minor variations.

    2-increases the code coverage

Cons:

The AI based  UI test automations systems are not quite effective for the testing of Mobile applications because 
a large set of consitions like no. of platforms,versions and browers versions
which raise the uncertaininty of how these system will handle these conditions.

3:AI based API Test Automation

As the simple API Test Automations tools records the API activities and traffice in order to analyze and create tests . 
but the modification and updation of theses tests, the testers needs to  get into the details of the REST calls and paramaters.

So the AI based API Test Automation  tools attempts to  elminated this problem by performing the traffic examining ,patterns identifications,in between API calls 
connections and then grouped them effectively according to the scenario.These tools also used existimgs tests in order to 
learn about the realtionship between APIs. This help to understand the chnages in Apis,and thus enable them to update  the existin tests or create the new 
tests according to scenraio.

Pros:

Cons:

-------------------------------------------( Top tools of AI test automation )-------------------------------------------
1: Applitools
2: Mabl
3: Test.ai
4: Eclipse
5: Functionize
6: ReTest
7: Parasoft SOAtest
8: Testim.io

----------------------------------------------------( Conclusion )---------------------------------------------------------
In the nut-shell, AI has very important impact in testing tools and in test automation of application program. With out the Artifical intelligent it take
a lot of time and even more difficulty in exectution of the test scenarios but with the use of this third layer in test automation it improve accuracy,
give better test converage,saves our lot of time and moeny,quickly insights the test results and also stable test automation.Many new features are
also being added in test automation of applications.
