                                                     ** Topic: AI based Test Automation for application testing **

Introduction:
Application/software testing have evolved a lot in decades.In Earlier ,there was only manual testing where each and every step was written
and executed manually.This was qite a time consuming task.For this automation has came in the form of different paid and open source tools.
they help us to automate the test cases and exectue them and generate reports.Now a third wave has struck in the worls of software testing 
with the advance artifical Intelligence.The overall evaution of application testing is:

Manual testing
-> Automation Tools(Eclipse,Katalon studio etc)
-> Frameworks(Test-NG,JUnit etc) 
-> CI/CD(Agile) 
-> AI(Third wave)

Testing and test automation in particular have "Everything's better with AI" bug.It is obvious that AI will find it's way into test automation 
in which AI Machine learning, and neural network are the trendy things right now.

What is AI and ML:
machine Learning us the subset of Artificial Intelligence learning.It is like giving machine ability to learn by itself.
For example if we search something on googlr and spend sometine in that specific thing.With the help of ML google will understand the users specific
needs and accordingly show those links and ads to that users.

why just Test automation is not enough??
As we have a large number of test auomation tools,test frame works but these are not enough.We are lagging some where in the testing department that's 
why AI with test automation become our need.The points where we have drawback for only Test Automations are as under:
1-Redundant test cases:which test pack/case are ideal and have big impact for testing the application
